# nanoform
A package for creating initial geometries of lipopeptide nanostructures for MARTINI simulations

    Built using python3.7

## Software prerequisites:
- Python3 (Tested on version 3.7.6)
- numpy (Tested on version 1.17.0)
- pandas (Test on version 1.1.3)
- Recommended visualization in VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)

## Description
This package contains Python scripts to generate initial geometries for MARTINI simulations of lipopeptide nanostructures to be run in GROMACS simulations. Initial geometries are generated from the .pdb and .top files generated by martinize.py (http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/tools2/proteins-and-bilayers/204-martinize)

main.py is the main script that lets you do all the above as shown by the examples
